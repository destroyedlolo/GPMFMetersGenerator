# GPMFMetersGenerator
Generate skickers from GoPro's GPMF

## Usage

```
GPMFMetersGenerator [options] file.MP4
```
(launch GPMFMetersGenerator without argument to have a list of reconized options)

A directory with the same name of the mp4 file (without it's extention) will be created to
hold resulting images / Videos.

## Dependancies 

- **Cairo** library is needed to generate PNG pics.
  - On source based distributions (Gentoo, ...), it sould be already installed if you're using a graphical environnement. Otherwise, install **x11-libs/cairo** package.
  - On binary based distributions (Debian, Suse ...), development version is needed. Please check for installation procedure [this page](https://www.cairographics.org/download/).
- **ffmpeg** binary vith **PNG** and **Quicktime** (.mov) support if you want GPMFMetersGenerator to generate videos.
